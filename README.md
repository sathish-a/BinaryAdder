# BinaryAdder
A model to do binary addition

A machine learning model to implement a binary adder<br>
This trained model adds one bit to the input and display it.<br>
Example:<br>
Input: [[0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1]] output: [[0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0]]<br>
123 is the given input, what it does is it gives the next number 124, by adding 1 to 123.<br>
There were no code written to do binary addition.<br>
The model has been trained to increment the given input by 1 (i.e) (+1) and it accepts only the numbers ranging from 0-254.<br>
Which means model can accept only 8 bits (You can change it as you wish).
