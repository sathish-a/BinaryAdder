# BinaryAdder
A model to do binary addition

A machine learning model to implement a binary adder<br>
This trained model add one bit to the input and displays it.<br>
Example:<br>
Input: [[0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1]] output: [[0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0]]<br>
123 is the given input, what it does is it gives the next number 124.<br>
The model has been trained to increment the given input by 1 (i.e) (+1)<br>
0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1<br>
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1<br>
